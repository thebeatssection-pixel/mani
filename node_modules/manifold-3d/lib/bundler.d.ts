 * This is a plugin for esbuild that has three functions:
 *   * It resolves NPM packages to urls served by various CDNs.
 *   * It fetches imports from http/https urls.
 *   * It provides evaluation context to npm packages.
 *
 * ManifoldCAD libraries can include `manifold-3d/manifoldCAD` to get access to
 * the evaluator context.  Outside of the evaluator, this involves importing a
 * module.  Inside the evaluator, imports are in the global namespace.  The
 * imported module will not be able to see the actual evaluator context.  Here,
 * we will swap it out for an object we will inject at evaluation time.
